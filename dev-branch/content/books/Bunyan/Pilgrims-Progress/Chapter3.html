<h2>{ The Wicket-Gate }</h2>
<PRE>

So, in process of time, Christian got up to the gate. Now,
over the gate there was written, "Knock, and it shall be
opened unto you."

<HR align="left" width="60" size="2" color="blue">

      He that will enter in must first without
      Stand knocking at the Gate, nor need he doubt
      That is A KNOCKER, but to enter in;
      For God can love him, and forgive his sin.

<HR align="left" width="60" size="2" color="blue">

He knocked, therefore, more than once or twice, saying: 

      May I now enter here? Will he within
      Open to sorry me, though I have been
      An undeserving rebel? Then shall I<A NAME="Good">
      Not fail to sing his lasting praise on high.</A>

At last there came a grave person to the gate, named <font size="+1">
<b>Good-will</b></font>, who asked who was there? and whence he came?
and what he would have?

<b>CHR.</b> Here is a poor burdened sinner. I come from the City of
Destruction, but am going to <b>Mount Zion</b>, that I may be delivered
from the wrath to come. I would therefore, Sir, since I am
informed that by this gate is the way thither, know if you are
<A NAME="GUD">willing to let me in?</A>

<b>GOOD.</b> I am willing with all my heart, said he; and with
that he opened the gate.

So when Christian was stepping in, the other gave him a pull.
Then said Christian, "What means that?" The other told him. "A
little distance from this gate, there is erected a strong
castle, of which <b>Beelzebub</b> is the captain; from thence, both he
and them that are with him shoot arrows at those that come up to
this gate, if haply they may die before they can enter in." Then
said Christian, "I rejoice and tremble." So when he was got in,
the man of the gate asked him who directed him thither?

<b>CHR.</b> Evangelist bid me come hither, and knock (as I did); and
he said that you, Sir, would tell me what I must do.

<b>GOOD.</b> An <b>open door is set before thee, and no man can shut
it. [Revelation 3:8]</b>

<b>CHR.</b> Now I begin to reap the benefits of my hazards.

<b>GOOD.</b> But how is it that you came alone?

<b>CHR.</b> Because none of my neighbours saw their danger, as I saw
mine.

<b>GOOD.</b> Did any of them know of your coming?

<b>CHR.</b> Yes; my wife and children saw me at the first, and called
after me to turn again; also, some of my neighbours stood crying
and calling after me to return; but I put my fingers in my ears,
and so came on my way.

<b>GOOD.</b> But did none of them follow you, to persuade you to
go back?

<b>CHR.</b> Yes, both Obstinate and Pliable; but when they saw that
they could not prevail, Obstinate went railing back, but Pliable
came with me a little way.

<b>GOOD.</b> But why did he not come through?

<b>CHR.</b> We, indeed, came both together, until we came at <b>the Slough
of Despond</b>, into the which we also suddenly fell. And then was
my neighbour, Pliable, discouraged, and would not venture
further. Wherefore, getting out again on that side next to his
own house, he told me I should possess the brave country alone
for him; so he went his way, and I came mine &#151;&#151; he after
Obstinate, and I to this gate.

<b>GOOD.</b> Then said Good-will, Alas, poor man! is the celestial
glory of so small esteem with him, that he counteth it not worth
running the hazards of a few difficulties to obtain it?

<b>CHR.</b> Truly, said Christian, I have said the truth of Pliable,
and if I should also say all the truth of myself, it will appear
there is no betterment betwixt him and myself. It is true, he
went back to his own house, but I also turned aside to go in the
way of death, being persuaded thereto by the carnal arguments of
one Mr. Worldly Wiseman.

<b>GOOD.</b> Oh, did he light upon you? What! he would have had
you a sought for ease at the hands of Mr. Legality. They are,
both of them, a very cheat. But did you take his counsel?

<b>CHR.</b> Yes, as far as I durst; I went to find out Mr. Legality,
until I thought that the mountain that stands by his house would
have fallen upon my head; wherefore there I was forced to stop.

<b>GOOD.</b> That mountain has been the death of many, and will be
the death of many more; it is well you escaped being by it
dashed in pieces.

<b>CHR.</b> Why, truly, I do not know what had become of me there, had
not Evangelist happily met me again, as I was musing in the
midst of my dumps; but it was God's mercy that he came to me
again, for else I had never come hither. But now I am come, such
a one as I am, more fit, indeed, for death, by that mountain,
than thus to stand talking with my lord; but, oh, what a favour
is this to me, that yet I am admitted entrance here!

<b>GOOD.</b> We make no objections against any, notwithstanding
all that they have done before they came hither. They are <b>in no
wise cast out&#185;</b>; and therefore, good Christian, come a little way
with me, and I will teach thee about <b>the way</b> thou must go. Look
before thee; dost thou see this narrow way? THAT is the way
thou must go; it was cast up by the patriarchs, prophets,
Christ, and his apostles; and it is as straight as a rule can
make it. This is <b>the way</b> thou must go. <b>[&#185;John 6:37]</b>

<b>CHR.</b> But, said Christian, are there no turnings or windings by
which a stranger may lose his way?

<b>GOOD.</b> Yes, there are many ways butt down upon this, and
they are crooked and wide. But thus thou mayest distinguish the
right from the wrong, the right only being <b>straight and narrow&#185;</b>.
<b>[&#185;<font color="blue">Matthew 7:14</font>]</b>

Then I saw in my dream that Christian asked him further if he
could not help him off with his burden that was upon his back;
for as yet he had not got rid thereof, nor could he by any means
get it off without help.

He told him, "As to thy burden, be content to bear it, until
thou comest to <b><i>the place of deliverance; for there it will fall
from thy back of itself.</i></b>"
<A NAME="Inter">
Then Christian began to gird up his loins, and to address</A>
himself to his journey. So the other told him, That by that he
was gone some distance from the gate, he would come at the house
of <font size="+1"><b>the Interpreter</b></font>, at whose door he should knock, and he
would shew him excellent things. Then Christian took his leave
of his friend, and he again bid him God-speed.
</PRE><A NAME=HOI>
<hr height="3" color="Green"></A>
<H2>{ The House of the Interpreter }</H2>
<PRE>
Then he went on till he came to the house of <b>the Interpreter</b>,
where he knocked over and over; at last one came to the door,
and asked who was there.

<b>CHR.</b> Sir, here is a traveller, who was bid by an acquaintance of
the good-man of this house to call here for my profit; I would
therefore speak with the master of the house. So he called for
the master of the house, who, after a little time, came to
Christian, and asked him what he would have.

<b>CHR.</b> Sir, said Christian, I am a man that am come from the City
of Destruction, and am going to the Mount Zion; and I was told
by the man that stands at the gate, at, the head of this way,
that if I called here, you would shew me excellent things, such
<A NAME="INTR">as would be a help to me in my journey.</A>

<b>INTR.</b> Then said <b>the Interpreter</b>, Come in; I will shew that
which will be profitable to thee. So he commanded his man to
light the candle, and bid Christian follow him: so he had him
into a private room, and bid his man open a door; the which when
he had done, Christian saw the picture of a very grave person
hung up against the wall; and this was the fashion of it. It had
eyes lifted up to heaven, the best of books in his hand, the law
of truth was written upon his lips, the world was behind his
back. It stood as if it pleaded with men, and a crown of gold
did hang over his head.

<b>CHR.</b> Then said Christian, What meaneth this?

<b>INTR.</b> The man whose picture this is, is one of a thousand; he
can beget children, travail in birth with children, and nurse
them himself when they are born. And whereas thou seest him with 
his eyes lift up to heaven, the best of books in his hand, and
the law of truth writ on his lips, it is to shew thee that his
work is to know and unfold dark things to sinners; even as also
thou seest him stand as if he pleaded with men: and whereas thou
seest the world as cast behind him, and that a crown hangs over
his head, that is to shew thee that slighting and despising the
things that are present, for the love that he hath to his
Master's service, he is sure in the world that comes next to
have glory for his reward. Now, said the Interpreter, I have
shewed thee this picture first, because the man whose picture
this is, is the only man whom the Lord of the place whither thou
art going, hath authorised to be thy guide in all difficult
places thou mayest meet with in the way; wherefore, take good
heed to what I have shewed thee, and bear well in thy mind what
thou hast seen, lest in thy journey thou meet with some that
pretend to lead thee right, but their way goes down to death.

Then he took him by the hand, and led him into a very large
parlour that was full of dust, because never swept; the which
after he had reviewed a little while, the Interpreter called for
a man to sweep. Now, when he began to sweep, the dust began so
abundantly to fly about, that Christian had almost therewith
been choked. Then said the Interpreter to a damsel that stood
by, "Bring hither the water, and sprinkle the room"; the which,
when she had done, it was swept and cleansed with pleasure.

<b>CHR.</b> Then said Christian, What means this?

<b>INTR.</b> The Interpreter answered, This parlour is the heart of a
man that was never sanctified by the sweet grace of the gospel;
the dust is his original sin and inward corruptions, that have
defiled the whole man. He that began to sweep at first, is the
Law; but she that brought water, and did sprinkle it, is the
Gospel. Now, whereas thou sawest, that so soon as the first
began to sweep, the dust did so fly about that the room by him
could not be cleansed, but that thou wast almost choked
therewith; this is to shew thee, that the law, instead of
cleansing the heart (by its working) from sin, doth revive, put
strength into, and increase it in the soul, even as it doth
discover and forbid it, for it doth not give power to subdue.

Again, as thou sawest the damsel sprinkle the room with water,
upon which it was cleansed with pleasure; this is to shew thee,
that when the gospel comes in the sweet and precious influences
thereof to the heart, then, I say, even as thou sawest the
damsel lay the dust by sprinkling the floor with water, so is
sin vanquished and subdued, and the soul made clean through the
faith of it, and consequently fit for <b>the King of glory</b> to
inhabit.

I saw, moreover, in my dream, that the Interpreter took him by
the hand, and had him into a little room, where sat two little
children, each one in his chair. The name of the eldest was
<b>Passion</b>, and the name of the other <b>Patience</b>. Passion seemed to
be much discontented; but Patience was very quiet. Then
Christian asked, What is the reason of the discontent of
Passion? The Interpreter answered, The Governor of them would
have him stay for his best things till the beginning of the next
year; but he will have all now: but Patience is willing to wait.

Then I saw that one came to Passion, and brought him a bag of
treasure, and poured it down at his feet, the which he took up
and rejoiced therein, and withal laughed Patience to scorn. But
I beheld but a while, and he had lavished all away, and had
nothing left him but rags.

<b>CHR.</b> Then said Christian to the Interpreter, "Expound this
matter more fully to me."

<b>INTR.</b> So he said, These two lads are <b>figures</b>: Passion, of the
men of this world; and Patience, of the men of that which is to
come; for as here thou seest, Passion will have all now this
year, that is to say, in this world; so are the men of this
world, they must have all their good things now, they cannot
stay till next year, that is until the next world, for their 
portion of good. That proverb, 'A bird in the hand is worth two
in the bush,' is of more authority with them than are all the
Divine testimonies of the good of the world to come. But as
thou sawest that he had quickly lavished all away, and had
presently left him nothing but rags; so will it be with all
such men at the end of this world.

<b>CHR.</b> Then said Christian, Now I see that Patience has the best
wisdom, and that upon many accounts. First, because he stays for
the best things. Second, and also because he will have the glory
of his, when the other has nothing but rags.

<b>INTR.</b> Nay, you may add another, to wit, the glory of the next
world will never wear out; but these are suddenly gone.
Therefore Passion had not so much reason to laugh at Patience,
because he had his good things first, as Patience will have to
laugh at Passion, because he had his best things last; for first
must give place to last, because last must have his time to
come; but last gives place to nothing; for there is not another
to succeed. He, therefore, that hath his portion first, must
needs have a time to spend it; but he that hath his portion
last, must have it lastingly; therefore it is said of Dives,
<b>Thou in thy life-time receivedst thy good things, and likewise
Lazarus evil things; but now he is comforted, and thou art
tormented&#185;</b>. <b>[&#185;Luke 16:25]</b>

<b>CHR.</b> Then I perceive it is not best to covet things that are
now, but to wait for things to come.

<b>INTR.</b> You say the truth: For the things which are seen are
temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal. But
though this be so, yet since things present and our fleshly
appetite are such near neighbours one to another; and again,
because things to come, and carnal sense, are such strangers
one to another; therefore it is, that the first of these so
suddenly fall into amity, and that distance is so continued
between the second.


Then I saw in my dream that the Interpreter took Christian by
the hand, and led him into a place where was a fire burning
against a wall, and one standing by it, always casting much
water upon it, to quench it; yet did the fire burn higher and
hotter.

Then said Christian, "What means this?"

The Interpreter answered, "This fire is the work of grace that is
wrought in the heart; he that casts water upon it, to extinguish
and put it out, is the Devil; but in that thou seest the fire
notwithstanding burn higher and hotter, thou shalt also see the
reason of that." So he had him about to the backside of the wall,
where he saw a man with a vessel of oil in his hand, of the
which he did also continually cast, but secretly, into the fire.

Then said Christian, "What means this?"

The Interpreter answered, "This is Christ, who continually, with
the oil of his grace, maintains the work already begun in the
heart: by the means of which, notwithstanding what the devil can
do, the souls of his people prove gracious still. And in that
thou sawest that the man stood behind the wall to maintain the
fire, that is to teach thee that it is hard for the tempted to
see how this work of grace is maintained in the soul."

I saw also, that the Interpreter took him again by the hand, and
led him into a pleasant place, where was builded a stately
palace, beautiful to behold; at the sight of which Christian was
greatly delighted. He saw also, upon the top thereof, certain
persons walking, who were clothed all in gold.

Then said Christian, "May we go in thither?"

Then the Interpreter took him, and led him up towards the door
of the palace; and behold, at the door stood a great company of
men, as desirous to go in; but durst not. There also sat a man
at a little distance from the door, at a table-side, with a book
and his inkhorn before him, to take the name of him that should
enter therein; he saw also, that in the doorway stood many men
in armour to keep it, being resolved to do the men that would
enter what hurt and mischief they could. Now was Christian
somewhat in amaze. At last, when every man started back for fear 
of the armed men, Christian saw a man of a very stout
countenance come up to the man that sat there to write, saying,
"Set down my name, Sir": the which when he had done, he saw the
man draw his sword, and put a helmet upon his head, and rush
toward the door upon the armed men, who laid upon him with
deadly force; but the man, not at all discouraged, fell to
cutting and hacking most fiercely. So after he had received and
given many wounds to those that attempted to keep him out, he
cut his way through them all, and pressed forward into the
palace, at which there was a pleasant voice heard from those
that were within, even of those that walked upon the top of the
palace, saying: 

      Come in, come in;
      Eternal glory thou shalt win.

So he went in, and was clothed with such garments as they. Then
Christian smiled and said, "I think verily I know the meaning
<A NAME="Cage">of this."</A>

"Now," said Christian, "let me go hence." "Nay, stay," said the
Interpreter, "till I have shewed thee a little more, and after
that thou shalt go on thy way." So he took him by the hand
again, and led him into a very dark room, where there sat <font size="+1"><b>a
man in an iron cage</b></font>.

Now the man, to look on, seemed very sad; he sat with his eyes
looking down to the ground, his hands folded together, and he
sighed as if he would break his heart. Then said Christian,
"What means this?" At which the Interpreter bid him talk with
the man.

Then said Christian to the man, "What art thou?" The man
answered, "I am what I was not once."

<A NAME="MAN"><b>CHR.</b> What wast thou once?</A>

<b>Man.</b> The man said, I was once a fair and flourishing professor,
both in mine own eyes, and also in the eyes of others; I once
was, as I thought, fair for the Celestial City, and had then
even joy at the thoughts that I should get thither.

<b>CHR.</b> Well, but what art thou now?

<b>Man.</b> I am now a man of despair, and am shut up in it, as in
this iron cage. I cannot get out. Oh, now I cannot!

<b>CHR.</b> But how camest thou in this condition?

<b>Man.</b> I left off to watch and be sober. I laid the reins, upon
the neck of my lusts; I sinned against the light of the Word and
the goodness of God; I have grieved the Spirit, and he is gone;
I tempted the devil, and he is come to me; I have provoked God
to anger, and he has left me: I have so hardened my heart, that
I cannot repent.

Then said Christian to the Interpreter, "But is there no hope
for such a man as this?" "Ask him," said the Interpreter. "Nay,
said Christian, pray, Sir, do you."

<b>INTR.</b> Then said the Interpreter, Is there no hope, but you must
be kept in the iron cage of despair?

<b>Man.</b> No, none at all.

<b>INTR.</b> Why, the Son of the Blessed is very pitiful.

<b>Man.</b> I have crucified him to myself afresh; I have despised his
person; I have despised his righteousness; I have counted his
blood an unholy thing; I have done despite to <b>the Spirit of
grace</b>. Therefore I have shut myself out of all the promises, and
there now remains to me nothing but threatenings, dreadful
threatenings, fearful threatenings, of certain judgment and
fiery indignation, which shall devour me as an adversary.

<b>INTR.</b> For what did you bring yourself into this condition?

<b>Man.</b> For the lusts, pleasures, and profits of this world; in the
enjoyment of which I did then promise myself much delight; but
now every one of those things also bite me, and gnaw me like a
burning worm.

<b>INTR.</b> But canst thou not now repent and turn?

<b>Man.</b> God hath denied me repentance. His Word gives me no
encouragement to believe; yea, himself hath shut me up in this
iron cage; nor can all the men in the world let me out. O
eternity, eternity! How shall I grapple with the misery that I
must meet with in eternity!

<b>INTR.</b> Then said the Interpreter to Christian, Let this man's
misery be remembered by thee, and be an everlasting caution to
thee.

<b>CHR.</b> Well, said Christian, this is fearful! God help me to watch
and be sober, and to pray that I may shun the cause of this
man's misery! Sir, is it not time for me to go on my way now?

<b>INTR.</b> Tarry till I shall shew thee one thing more, and then
thou shalt go on thy way.

So he took Christian by the hand again, and led him into a
chamber, where there was one rising out of bed; and as he put on
his raiment he shook and trembled. Then said Christian, Why doth
this man thus tremble? The Interpreter then bid him tell to
Christian the reason of his so doing. So he began and said, This
night, as I was in my sleep, I dreamed, and behold the heavens
grew exceeding black; also it thundered and lightened in most
fearful wise, that it put me into an agony; so I looked up in my
dream, and saw the clouds rack at an unusual rate, upon which I
heard a great sound of a trumpet, and saw also a man sit upon a
cloud, attended with the thousands of heaven; they were all in
flaming fire: also the heavens were in a burning flame. I heard
then a voice saying, "Arise, ye dead, and come to judgment"; and
with that the rocks rent, the graves opened, and the dead that
were therein came forth. Some of them were exceeding glad, and
looked upward; and some sought to hide themselves under the
mountains. Then I saw the man that sat upon the cloud open the
book, and bid the world draw near. Yet there was, by reason of a
fierce flame which issued out and came from before him, a
convenient distance betwixt him and them, as betwixt the judge
and the prisoners at the bar. I heard it also proclaimed to them
that attended on the man that sat on the cloud, "Gather together
the tares, the chaff, and stubble, and cast them into the
burning lake." And with that, the bottomless pit opened, just
whereabout I stood; out of the mouth of which there came, in an
abundant manner, smoke and coals of fire, with hideous noises.
It was also said to the same persons, "Gather my wheat into the
garner." And with that I saw many catched up and carried away
into the clouds, but I was left behind. I also sought to hide
myself, but I could not, for the man that sat upon the cloud
still kept his eye upon me; my sins also came into my mind; and
my conscience did accuse me on every side. Upon this I awaked
from my sleep.

<b>CHR.</b> But what is it that made you so afraid of this sight?

<b>Man.</b> Why, I thought that the day of judgment was come, and that
I was not ready for it: but this frighted me most, that the
angels gathered up several, and left me behind; also the pit of
hell opened her mouth just where I stood. My conscience, too,
afflicted me; and, as I thought, the Judge had always his eye
upon me, shewing indignation in his countenance.

Then said the Interpreter to Christian, "Hast thou considered
all these things?"

<b>CHR.</b> Yes, and they put me in hope and fear.

<b>INTR.</b> Well, keep all things so in thy mind that they may be as
a goad in thy sides, to prick thee forward in the way thou must
go. Then Christian began to gird up his loins, and to address
himself to his journey. Then said the Interpreter, <b>The Comforter</b>
be always with thee, good Christian, to guide thee in the way
that leads to the City. So Christian went on his way, saying: 

      Here I have seen things rare and profitable;
      Things pleasant, dreadful, things to make me stable
      In what I have begun to take in hand;
      Then let me think on them and understand
      Wherefore they shewed me were, and let me be
      Thankful, O good Interpreter, to thee.
