<H3>{ The Pilgrims meet Ignorance from the Country of Conceit }</H3>
<PRE>

<A NAME="Igno">
<font size="+1"><b>And I slept, and dreamed again</b></font>, and saw the same two</A>
Pilgrims going down the mountains along the highway towards the
city. Now, a little below these mountains, on the left hand,
lieth <b>the country of Conceit</b>; from which country there comes
into The Way in which the Pilgrims walked, a little crooked
lane. Here, therefore, they met with a very brisk lad, that
came out of that country; and his name was <font size="+1"><b>Ignorance</b></font>. So
Christian asked him from what parts he came, and whither he
<A NAME="IGN">was going.</A>


<b>Igno.</b> Sir, I was born in the country that lieth off there a
little on the left hand, and I am going to the Celestial City.

<b>CHR.</b> But how do you think to get in at the gate? for you may
find some difficulty there.

<b>Igno.</b> As other people do, said he.

<b>CHR.</b> But what have you to shew at that gate, that may cause that
the gate should be opened to you?

<b>Igno.</b> I know my Lord's will, and I have been a good liver; I
pay every man his own; I pray, fast, pay tithes, and give alms,
and have left my country for whither I am going.

<b>CHR.</b> But thou camest not in at <b>the wicket-gate</b> that is at the
head of this way; thou camest in hither through that same
crooked lane, and therefore, I fear, however thou mayest think
of thyself, when the reckoning day shall come, thou wilt have
laid to thy charge that thou art a thief and a robber, instead
of getting admittance into the city.

<b>Igno.</b> Gentlemen, ye be utter strangers to me, I know you not;
be content and follow the religion of your country, and I will
follow the religion of mine. I hope all will be well. And as for
the gate that you talk of, all the world knows that that is a
great way off of our country. I cannot think that any man in all
our parts doth so much as know the way to it, nor need they
matter whether they do or no, since we have, as you see, a fine,
pleasant green lane, that comes down from our country, the next
way into the way.

When Christian saw that the man was wise in his own conceit, he
said to Hopeful, whisperingly, "There is more hope of a fool
than of him." And said, moreover, "When he that is a fool
walketh by the way, his wisdom faileth him, and he saith to
every one that he is a fool. What, shall we talk further with
him, or out-go him at present, and so leave him to think of
what he hath heard already, and then stop again for him
afterwards, and see if by degrees we can do any good to him?"

Then said Hopeful:

      Let Ignorance a little while now muse
      On what is said, and let him not refuse
      Good counsel to embrace, lest he remain
      Still ignorant of what's the chiefest gain.
      God saith, those that no understanding have,
      Although he made them, them he will not save.

<b>HOPE.</b> He further added, It is not good, I think, to say all to
him at once; let us pass him by, if you will, and talk to him
anon, even as he is able to bear it.

<H3>{ <i>Chrisitan</i> tells <i>Hopeful</i> a story about one named &quot;Little-faith&quot; }</H3>
<PRE>
<b>So</b> they both went on, and Ignorance he came after. Now when they
had passed him a little way, they entered into a very dark lane,
where they met a man whom seven devils had bound with seven
strong cords, and were carrying of him back to the door that
they saw on the side of the hill. Now good Christian began to
tremble, and so did Hopeful his companion; yet as the devils led
away the man, Christian looked to see if he knew him; and he
thought it might be one <b>Turn-away</b>, that dwelt in the town of
<b>Apostasy</b>. But he did not perfectly see his face, for he did hang
his head like a thief that is found. But being once past,
Hopeful looked after him, and espied on his back a paper with
this inscription, "Wanton professor and damnable apostate." Then
said Christian to his fellow, "Now I call to remembrance, that
which was told me of a thing that happened to a good man
hereabout. The name of the man was <b>Little-faith</b>, but a good man,
and he dwelt in the town of <b>Sincere</b>. The thing was this: At the
entering in at this passage, there comes down from <b>Broad-way
Gate</b>, a lane called Dead Man's Lane; so called because of the
murders that are commonly done there; and this Little-faith
going on pilgrimage, as we do now, chanced to sit down there,
and slept. Now there happened, at that time, to come down the
lane, from Broad-way Gate, three sturdy rogues, and their names
were <b>Faint-heart</b>, <b>Mistrust</b>, and <b>Guilt</b>, (three brothers,) and
they espying Little-faith, where he was, came galloping up with
speed. Now the good man was just awake from his sleep, and was
getting up to go on his journey. So they came up all to him, and
with threatening language bid him stand. At this Little-faith
looked as white as a clout, and had neither power to fight nor
fly. Then said Faint-heart, "Deliver thy purse." But he making
no haste to do it (for he was loath to lose his money), Mistrust
ran up to him, and thrusting his hand into his pocket, pulled
out thence a bag of silver. Then he cried out, "Thieves!
Thieves!" With that Guilt, with a great club that was in his
hand, struck Little-faith on the head, and with that blow felled
him flat to the ground, where he lay bleeding as one that would
bleed to death. All this while the thieves stood by. But, at
last, they hearing that some were upon the road, and fearing
lest it should be one <b>Great-grace</b>, that dwells in the city of
<b>Good-confidence</b>, they betook themselves to their heels, and left
this good man to shift for himself. Now, after a while,
Little-faith came to himself, and getting up, made shift to
scrabble on his way. This was the story.

<b>HOPE.</b> But did they take from him all that ever he had?

<b>CHR.</b> No; the place where his jewels were they never ransacked,
so those he kept still. But, as I was told, the good man was
much afflicted for his loss, for the thieves got most of his
spending-money. That which they got not (as I said) were jewels,
also he had a little odd money left, but scarce enough to bring
him to his journey's end; nay, if I was not misinformed, he was
forced to beg as he went, to keep himself alive; for his jewels
he might not sell. But beg, and do what he could, he went (as
we say) with many a hungry belly the most part of the rest of
the way.

<b>HOPE.</b> But is it not a wonder they got not from him his
certificate, by which he was to receive his admittance at the
Celestial Gate?

<b>CHR.</b> It is a wonder; but they got not that, though they missed
it not through any good cunning of his; for he, being dismayed
with their coming upon him, had neither power nor skill to hide
anything; so it was more by good Providence than by his
endeavour, that they missed of that good thing.

<b>HOPE.</b> But it must needs be a comfort to him, that they got not
his jewels from him.

<b>CHR.</b> It might have been great comfort to him, had he used it as
he should; but they that told me the story said, that he made
but little use of it all the rest of the way, and that because
of the dismay that he had in the taking away his money; indeed,
he forgot it a great part of the rest of his journey; and
besides, when at any time it came into his mind, and he began to
be comforted therewith, then would fresh thoughts of his loss
come again upon him, and those thoughts would swallow up all.

<b>HOPE.</b> Alas! poor man! This could not but be a great grief to
him.

<b>CHR.</b> Grief! ay, a grief indeed. Would it not have been so to any
of us, had we been used as he, to be robbed, and wounded too,
and that in a strange place, as he was? It is a wonder he did
not die with grief, poor heart! I was told that he scattered
almost all the rest of the way with nothing but doleful and
bitter complaints; telling also to all that overtook him, or
that he overtook in the way as he went, where he was robbed, and
how; who they were that did it, and what he lost; how he was
wounded, and that he hardly escaped with his life.

<b>HOPE.</b> But it is a wonder that his necessity did not put him upon
selling or pawning some of his jewels, that he might have
wherewith to relieve himself in his journey.

<b>CHR.</b> Thou talkest like one upon whose head is the shell to this
very day; for what should he pawn them, or to whom should he
sell them? In all that country where he was robbed, his jewels
were not accounted of; nor did he want that relief which could
from thence be administered to him. Besides, had his jewels been
missing at the gate of the Celestial City, he had (and that he
knew well enough) been excluded from an inheritance there; and
that would have been worse to him than the appearance and
villainy of ten thousand thieves.

<b>HOPE.</b> Why art thou so tart, my brother? Esau sold his
birthright, and that for a mess of pottage, and that birthright
was his greatest jewel; and if he, why might not Little-faith
do so too?

<b>CHR.</b> Esau did sell his birthright indeed, and so do many
besides, and by so doing exclude themselves from the chief
blessing, as also that caitiff did; but you must put a
difference betwixt Esau and Little-faith, and also betwixt their
estates. Esau's birthright was typical, but Little-faith's
jewels were not so; Esau's belly was his god, but Little-faith's
belly was not so; Esau's want lay in his fleshly appetite,
Little-faith's did not so. Besides, Esau could see no further
than to the fulfilling of his lusts; "Behold, I am at the point
to die," said he, "and what profit shall this birthright do me?"
But Little-faith, though it was his lot to have but a little
faith, was by his little faith kept from such extravagances, and
made to see and prize his jewels more than to sell them, as Esau
did his birthright. You read not anywhere that Esau had faith,
no, not so much as a little; therefore, no marvel if, where the
flesh only bears sway (as it will in that man where no faith is
to resist), if he sells his birthright, and his soul and all,
and that to the devil of hell; for it is with such, as it is
with the ass, who in her occasions cannot be turned away. When
their minds are set upon their lusts, they will have them
whatever they cost. But Little-faith was of another temper, his
mind was on things divine; his livelihood was upon things that
were spiritual, and from above; therefore, to what end should he
that is of such a temper sell his jewels (had there been any
that would have bought them) to fill his mind with empty things?
Will a man give a penny to fill his belly with hay; or can you
persuade the turtle-dove to live upon carrion like the crow?
Though faithless ones can, for carnal lusts, pawn, or mortgage,
or sell what they have, and themselves outright to boot; yet
they that have faith, saving faith, though but a little of it,
cannot do so. Here, therefore, my brother, is thy mistake.

<b>HOPE.</b> I acknowledge it; but yet your severe reflection had
almost made me angry.

<b>CHR.</b> Why, I did but compare thee to some of the birds that are
of the brisker sort, who will run to and fro in untrodden paths,
with the shell upon their heads; but pass by that, and consider
the matter under debate, and all shall be well betwixt thee and
me.

<b>HOPE.</b> But, Christian, these three fellows, I am persuaded in my
heart, are but a company of cowards; would they have run else,
think you, as they did, at the noise of one that was coming on
the road? Why did not Little-faith pluck up a greater heart? He
might, methinks, have stood one brush with them, and have
yielded when there had been no remedy.

<b>CHR.</b> That they are cowards, many have said, but few have found
it so in the time of trial. As for a great heart, Little-faith
had none; and I perceive by thee, my brother, hadst thou been
the man concerned, thou art but for a brush, and then to yield.
And, verily, since this is the height of thy stomach, now they
are at a distance from us, should they appear to thee as they
did to him they might put thee to second thoughts.

But, consider again, they are but journeymen thieves, they serve
under the king of the bottomless pit, who, if need be, will come
into their aid himself, and his voice is as the roaring of a
lion. I myself have been engaged as this Little-faith was, and
I found it a terrible thing. These three villains set upon me,
and I beginning, like a Christian, to resist, they gave but a
call, and in came their master. I would, as the saying is, have
given my life for a penny, but that, as God would have it, I
was clothed with armour of proof. Ay, and yet, though I was so
harnessed, I found it hard work to quit myself like a man. No
man can tell what in that combat attends us, but he that hath
been in the battle himself.

<b>HOPE.</b> Well, but they ran, you see, when they did but suppose
that one Great-grace was in the way.

<b>CHR.</b> True, they have often fled, both they and their master,
when Great-grace hath but appeared; and no marvel; for he is
the King's champion. But, I trow, you will put some difference
betwixt Little-faith and the King's champion. All the King's
subjects are not his champions, nor can they, when tried, do
such feats of war as he. Is it meet to think that a little child
should handle Goliath as David did? Or that there should be the
strength of an ox in a wren? Some are strong, some are weak;
some have great faith, some have little. This man was one of the
weak, and therefore he went to the wall.

<b>HOPE.</b> I would it had been Great-grace for their sakes.

<b>CHR.</b> If it had been, he might have had his hands full; for I
must tell you, that though Great-grace is excellent good at his
weapons, and has, and can, so long as he keeps them at sword's
point, do well enough with them; yet, if they get within him,
even Faint-heart, Mistrust, or the other, it shall go hard but
they will throw up his heels. And when a man is down, you know,
what can he do?

Whoso looks well upon Great-grace's face, shall see those scars
and cuts there, that shall easily give demonstration of what I
say. Yea, once I heard that he should say (and that when he was
in the combat), We despaired even of life. How did these sturdy
rogues and their fellows make David groan, mourn, and roar? Yea,
Heman, and Hezekiah, too, though champions in their day, were
forced to bestir them, when by these assaulted; and yet,
notwithstanding, they had their coats soundly brushed by them.
Peter, upon a time, would go try what he could do; but though
some do say of him that he is the prince of the apostles, they
handled him so, that they made him at last afraid of a sorry
girl. Besides, their king is at their whistle. He is never out
of hearing; and if at any time they be put to the worst, he, if
possible, comes in to help them; and of him it is said, The
sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold the spear, the dart,
nor the habergeon; he esteemeth iron as straw, and brass as
rotten wood. The arrow cannot make him flee; sling stones are
turned with him into stubble. Darts are counted as stubble: he
laugheth at the shaking of a spear. What can a man do in this
case? It is true, if a man could, at every turn, have Job's
horse, and had skill and courage to ride him, he might do 
notable things; for his neck is clothed with thunder, he will
not be afraid of the grasshopper; the glory of his nostrils is
terrible: he paweth in the valley, and rejoiceth in his
strength, he goeth on to meet the armed men. He mocketh at fear,
and is not affrighted, neither turneth he back from the sword.
The quiver rattleth against him, the glittering spear, and the
shield. He swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage,
neither believeth he that it is the sound of the trumpet. He
saith among the trumpets, Ha, ha! and he smelleth the battle
afar off, the thunder of the captains, and the shouting.

But for such footmen as thee and I are, let us never desire to
meet with an enemy, nor vaunt as if we could do better, when we
hear of others that they have been foiled, Nor be tickled at the
thoughts of our own manhood; for such commonly come by the worst
when tried. Witness Peter, of whom I made mention before. He
would swagger, ay, he would; he would, as his vain mind prompted
him to say, do better, and stand more for his Master than all
men; but who so foiled, and run down by these villains, as he?

When, therefore, we hear that such robberies are done on the
King's highway, two things become us to do:

<b>1.</b> To go out harnessed, and to be sure to take a shield with us;
for it was for want of that, that he that laid so lustily at
Leviathan could not make him yield; for, indeed, if that be
wanting, he fears us not at all. Therefore, he that had skill 
hath said, Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye
shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.

<b>2.</b> It is good, also, that we desire of the King a convoy, yea,
that he will go with us himself. This made David rejoice when in
the Valley of the Shadow of Death; and Moses was rather for
dying where he stood, than to go one step without his God. Oh,
my brother, if he will but go along with us, what need we be
afraid of ten thousands that shall set themselves against us?
But, without him, the proud helpers fall under the slain.

I, for my part, have been in the fray before now; and though,
through the goodness of him that is best, I am, as you see,
alive, yet I cannot boast of my manhood. Glad shall I be, if I
meet with no more such brunts; though I fear we are not got
beyond all danger. However, since the lion and the bear have not
as yet devoured me, I hope God will also deliver us from the
next uncircumcised Philistine. Then sang Christian:

      Poor Little-faith! Hast been among the thieves?
      Wast robb'd? Remember this, whoso believes,
      And gets more faith, shall then a victor be
      Over ten thousand, else scarce over three.

<b>So</b> they went on and Ignorance followed. They went then till they
came at a place where they saw a way put itself into their way,
and seemed withal to lie as straight as the way which they
should go: and here they knew not which of the two to take, for
both seemed straight before them; therefore, here they stood
still to consider. And as they were thinking about the way,
behold a man, black of flesh, but covered with a very light
robe, came to them, and asked them why they stood there. They
answered they were going to the Celestial City, but knew not
which of these ways to take. "Follow me," said the man, "it is
thither that I am going." So they followed him in the way that
but now came into the road, which by degrees turned, and turned
them so from the city that they desired to go to, that, in
little time, their faces were turned away from it; yet they
followed him. But by and by, before they were aware, he led them
both within the compass of a net, in which they were both so
entangled that they knew not what to do; and with that the white
robe fell off the black man's back. Then they saw where they
were. Wherefore, there they lay crying some time, for they could
not get themselves out.

<b>CHR.</b> Then said Christian to his fellow, Now do I see myself in
error. Did not <b>the Shepherds</b> bid us beware of <b>the flatterers</b>? As
is the saying of the wise man, so we have found it this day. A
man that flattereth his neighbour, spreadeth a net for his feet.

<b>HOPE.</b> They also gave us a note of directions about the way, for
our more sure finding thereof; but therein we have also
forgotten to read, and have not kept ourselves from the paths of
the destroyer. Here David was wiser than we; for saith he,
Concerning the works of men, by The Word of Thy lips, I have
kept me from the paths of the destroyer.

Thus they lay bewailing themselves in the net. At last they
espied <b>a Shining One</b> coming towards them with a whip of small
cord in his hand. When he was come to the place where they were,
he asked them whence they came, and what they did there. They
told him that they were poor pilgrims going to Zion, but were
led out of their way by a black man, "clothed in white, who bid
us," said they, "follow him, for he was going thither too." Then
said he with the whip, "It is <b>Flatterer, a false apostle,
that hath transformed himself into an angel of light.</b> So he
rent the net, and let the men out. Then said he to them, "Follow
me, that I may set you in your way again." So he led them back
to the way which they had left to follow the Flatterer. Then he
asked them, saying, "Where did you lie the last night?" They
said, "With the Shepherds upon the Delectable Mountains." He
asked them then if they had not of those Shepherds a note of
direction for the way. They answered, "Yes." "But did you," said
he, "when you were at a stand, pluck out and read your note?"
They answered, "No." He asked them, "Why?" They said, they
forgot. He asked, moreover, if the Shepherds did not bid them
beware of the Flatterer? They answered, "Yes, but we did not
imagine," said they, "that this fine-spoken man had been he."


<font size="+1"><b>Then I saw</b></font> in my dream that he commanded them to lie down;
which, when they did, he chastised them sore, to teach them the
good way wherein they should walk; and as he chastised them he
said, "As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten; be zealous,
therefore, and repent." This done, he bid them go on their way,
and take good heed to the other directions of the shepherds. So
they thanked him for all his kindness, and went softly along
the right way, singing:

      Come hither, you that walk along the way;
      See how the pilgrims fare that go astray.
      They catched are in an entangling net,
      'Cause they good counsel lightly did forget:
      'Tis true they rescued were, but yet you see,
      They're scourged to boot. Let this your caution be.
