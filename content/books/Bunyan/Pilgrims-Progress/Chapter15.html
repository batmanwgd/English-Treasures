<font size="+1"><b>I saw then</b></font> in my dream that Hopeful looked back and saw
Ignorance, whom they had left behind, coming after. "Look,"
said he to Christian, "how far yonder youngster loitereth
behind."

<b>CHR.</b> Ay, ay, I see him; he careth not for our company.

<b>HOPE.</b> But I trow it would not have hurt him had he kept pace
with us hitherto.

<b>CHR.</b> That is true; but I warrant you he thinketh otherwise.

<b>HOPE.</b> That, I think, he doth; but, however, let us tarry for
him. So they did.

Then Christian said to him, "Come away, man, why do you stay so
<A NAME="IGN">behind?"

<b>Igno.</b> I take my pleasure in walking alone, even more a great
deal than in company, unless I like it the better.
<A NAME="Igno">
Then said Christian to Hopeful, but softly, "Did I not tell you</A>
he cared not for our company?" But, however, said he, "come up,
and let us talk away the time in this solitary place." Then
directing his speech to <b>Ignorance</b>, he said, "Come, how do you?
How stands it between God and your soul now?"

<b>Igno.</b> I hope well; for I am always full of good motions, that
come into my mind, to comfort me as I walk.

<b>CHR.</b> What good motions? pray, tell us.

<b>Igno.</b> Why, I think of God and heaven.

<b>CHR.</b> So do the devils and damned souls.

<b>Igno.</b> But I think of them and desire them.

<b>CHR.</b> So do many that are never like to come there. The soul of
the sluggard desireth, and hath nothing.

<b>Igno.</b> But I think of them, and leave all for them.

<b>CHR.</b> That I doubt; for leaving all is a hard matter: yea, a
harder matter than many are aware of. But why, or by what, art
thou persuaded that thou hast left all for God and heaven.

<b>Igno.</b> My heart tells me so.

<b>CHR.</b> The wise man says, He that trusts his own heart is a fool.

<b>Igno.</b> This is spoken of an evil heart, but mine is a good one.

<b>CHR.</b> But how dost thou prove that?

<b>Igno.</b> It comforts me in hopes of heaven.

<b>CHR.</b> That may be through its deceitfulness; for a man's heart
may minister comfort to him in the hopes of that thing for which
he yet has no ground to hope.

<b>Igno.</b> But my heart and life agree together, and therefore my
hope is well grounded.

<b>CHR.</b> Who told thee that thy heart and life agree together?

<b>Igno.</b> My heart tells me so.

<b>CHR.</b> Ask my fellow if I be a thief! Thy heart tells thee so!
Except the Word of God beareth witness in this matter, other
testimony is of no value.

<b>Igno.</b> But is it not a good heart that hath good thoughts? And
is not that a good life that is according to God's commandments?

<b>CHR.</b> Yes, that is a good heart that hath good thoughts, and that
is a good life that is according to God's commandments; but it
is one thing, indeed, to have these, and another thing only
to think so.

<b>Igno.</b> Pray, what count you good thoughts, and a life according
to God's commandments?

<b>CHR.</b> There are good thoughts of divers kinds; some respecting
ourselves, some God, some Christ, and some other things.

<b>Igno.</b> What be good thoughts respecting ourselves?

<b>CHR.</b> Such as agree with the Word of God.

<b>Igno.</b> When do our thoughts of ourselves agree with the Word of
God?

<b>CHR.</b> When we pass the same judgment upon ourselves
which the Word passes. To explain myself:  The Word of God
saith of persons in a natural condition, '<b>There is none
righteous, there is none that doeth good&#185;</b>.' It saith also, <b>that
every imagination of the heart of man is only evil, and that
continually.&#178;</b> And again, <b>The imagination of man's heart is evil
from his youth&#179;.</b> Now then, when we think thus of ourselves,
having sense thereof, then are our thoughts good ones, because
according to the Word of God. <b>[&#185;Romans 3:10,12. &#178;Genesis 6:5.
&#179;Ge 8:21.]</b>

<b>Igno.</b> I will never believe that my heart is thus bad.

<b>CHR.</b> Therefore thou never hadst one good thought concerning
thyself in thy life. But let me go on. As the Word passeth a
judgment upon our heart, so it passeth a judgment upon our ways;
and when OUR thoughts of our hearts and ways agree with the
judgment which the Word giveth of both, then are both good,
because agreeing thereto.

<b>Igno.</b> Make out your meaning.

<b>CHR.</b> Why, the Word of God saith that man's ways are crooked
ways; not good, but perverse. It saith they are naturally out of
the good way, that they have not known it. Now, when a man thus
thinketh of his ways, &#151;&#151; I say, when he doth sensibly, and with
heart-humiliation, thus think, then hath he good thoughts of his
own ways, because his thoughts now agree with the judgment of
the Word of God.

<b>Igno.</b> What are good thoughts concerning God?

<b>CHR.</b> Even as I have said concerning ourselves, when our thoughts
of God do agree with what the Word saith of him; and that is,
when we think of his being and attributes as the Word hath
taught, of which I cannot now discourse at large; but to speak
of him with reference to us: Then we have right thoughts of
God, when we think that he knows us better than we know
ourselves, and can see sin in us when and where we can see none
in ourselves; when we think he knows our inmost thoughts, and
that our heart, with all its depths, is always open unto his
eyes; also, when we think that all our righteousness stinks in
his nostrils, and that, therefore, he cannot abide to see us
stand before him in any confidence, even in all our best
performances.

<b>Igno.</b> Do you think that I am such a fool as to think God can
see no further than I? or, that I would come to God in the best
of my performances?

<b>CHR.</b> Why, how dost thou think in this matter?

<b>Igno.</b> Why, to be short, I think I must believe in Christ for
justification.

<b>CHR.</b> How! think thou must believe in Christ, when thou seest not
thy need of him! Thou neither seest thy original nor actual
infirmities; but hast such an opinion of thyself, and of what
thou dost, as plainly renders thee to be one that did never see
a necessity of Christ's personal righteousness to justify thee
before God. How, then, dost thou say, I believe in Christ?

<b>Igno.</b> I believe well enough for all that.

<b>CHR.</b> How dost thou believe?

<b>Igno.</b> I believe that Christ died for sinners, and that I shall
be justified before God from the curse, through his gracious
acceptance of my obedience to his law. Or thus, Christ makes my
duties, that are religious, acceptable to his Father, by virtue
of his merits; and so shall I be justified.

<b>CHR.</b> Let me give an answer to this confession of thy faith: 

<b>1.</b> Thou believest with a fantastical faith; for this faith is
nowhere described in the Word.

<b>2.</b> Thou believest with a false faith; because it taketh
justification from the personal righteousness of Christ, and
applies it to thy own.

<b>3.</b> This faith maketh not Christ a justifier of thy person, but
of thy actions; and of thy person for thy action's sake, which
is false.

<b>4.</b> Therefore, this faith is deceitful, even such as will leave
thee under wrath, in the day of God Almighty; for true
justifying faith puts the soul, as sensible of its condition by
the law, upon flying for refuge unto Christ's righteousness,
which righteousness of his is not an act of grace, by which he
maketh for justification, thy obedience accepted with God; but
his personal obedience to the law, in doing and suffering for us
what that required at our hands; this righteousness, I say, true
faith accepteth; under the skirt of which, the soul being
shrouded, and by it presented as spotless before God, it is
accepted, and acquit from condemnation.

<b>Igno.</b> What! would you have us trust to what Christ, in his own
person, has done without us? This conceit would loosen the reins
of our lust, and tolerate us to live as we list; for what matter
how we live, if we may be justified by Christ's personal
righteousness from all, when we believe it?

<b>CHR.</b> Ignorance is thy name, and as thy name is, so art thou;
even this thy answer demonstrateth what I say. Ignorant thou art
of what justifying righteousness is, and as ignorant how to
secure thy soul, through the faith of it, from the heavy wrath
of God. Yea, thou also art ignorant of the true effects of
saving faith in this righteousness of Christ, which is, to bow
and win over the heart to God in Christ, to love his name, his
word, ways, and people, and not as thou ignorantly imaginest.

<b>HOPE.</b> Ask him if ever he had Christ revealed to him from heaven.

<b>Igno.</b> What! you are a man for revelations! I believe that what
both you, and all the rest of you, say about that matter, is but
the fruit of distracted brains.

<b>HOPE.</b> Why, man! Christ is so hid in God from the natural
apprehensions of the flesh, that he cannot by any man be
savingly known, unless God the Father reveals him to them.

<b>Igno.</b> That is your faith, but not mine; yet mine, I doubt not,
is as good as yours, though I have not in my head so many
whimsies as you.

<b>CHR.</b> Give me leave to put in a word. You ought not so slightly
to speak of this matter; for this I will boldly affirm, even as
my good companion hath done, that no man can know Jesus Christ
but by the revelation of the Father; yea, and faith too, by
which the soul layeth hold upon Christ, if it be right, must be
wrought by the exceeding greatness of his mighty power; the
working of which faith, I perceive, poor Ignorance, thou art
ignorant of. Be awakened, then, see thine own wretchedness, and
fly to the Lord Jesus; and by his righteousness, which is the
righteousness of God, for he himself is God, thou shalt be
delivered from condemnation.

<b>Igno.</b> You go so fast, I cannot keep pace with you. Do you go
on before; I must stay a while behind.

Then they said:

      Well, Ignorance, wilt thou yet foolish be,
      To slight good counsel, ten times given thee?
      And if thou yet refuse it, thou shalt know,
      Ere long, the evil of thy doing so.
      Remember, man, in time, stoop, do not fear;
      Good counsel taken well, saves: therefore hear.
      But if thou yet shalt slight it, thou wilt be
      The loser, Ignorance, I'll warrant thee.


Then Christian addressed thus himself to his fellow: 

<b>CHR.</b> Well, come, my good Hopeful, I perceive that thou and I
must walk by ourselves again.

<H2>{ The Pilgrims Examine the Condition of <i>Ignorance</i> }</H2>
<PRE>

<font size="+1"><b>So I saw</b></font> in my dream that they went on apace before, and
Ignorance he came hobbling after. Then said Christian to his
companion, "It pities me much for this poor man, it will
certainly go ill with him at last."

<b>HOPE.</b> Alas! there are abundance in our town in his condition,
whole families, yea, whole streets, and that of pilgrims too;
and if there be so many in our parts, how many, think you, must
there be in the place where he was born?

<b>CHR.</b> Indeed the Word saith, He hath blinded their eyes lest they
should see, &c. But now we are by ourselves, what do you think
of such men? Have they at no time, think you, convictions of sin, 
and so consequently fears that their state is dangerous?

<b>HOPE.</b> Nay, do you answer that question yourself, for you are the
elder man.

<b>CHR.</b> Then I say, sometimes (as I think) they may; but they being
naturally ignorant, understand not that such convictions tend to
their good; and therefore they do desperately seek to stifle
them, and presumptuously continue to flatter themselves in the
way of their own hearts.

<b>HOPE.</b> I do believe, as you say, that fear tends much to men's
good, and to make them right, at their beginning to go on
pilgrimage.

<b>CHR.</b> Without all doubt it doth, if it be right; for so says the
Word, The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.

<b>HOPE.</b> How will you describe right fear?

<b>CHR.</b> True or right fear is discovered by three things: 

<b>1.</b> By its rise; it is caused by saving convictions for sin.

<b>2.</b> It driveth the soul to lay fast hold of Christ for salvation.

<b>3.</b> It begetteth and continueth in the soul a great reverence of
God, his Word, and ways, keeping it tender, and making it afraid
to turn from them, to the right hand or to the left, to anything
that may dishonour God, break its peace, grieve the Spirit, or
cause the enemy to speak reproachfully.

<b>HOPE.</b> Well said; I believe you have said the truth. Are we now
almost got past <b>the Enchanted Ground?</b>

<b>CHR.</b> Why, art thou weary of this discourse?

<b>HOPE.</b> No, verily, but that I would know where we are.

<b>CHR.</b> We have not now above two miles further to go thereon. But
let us return to our matter. Now the ignorant know not that such
convictions as tend to put them in fear are for their good, and
therefore they seek to stifle them.

<b>HOPE.</b> How do they seek to stifle them?

<b>CHR.</b> <b>1.</b> They think that those fears are wrought by the devil,
though indeed they are wrought of God; and, thinking so, they
resist them as things that directly tend to their overthrow. <b>2.</b>
They also think that these fears tend to the spoiling of their
faith, when, alas, for them, poor men that they are, they have
none at all! and therefore they harden their. hearts against
them. <b>3.</b> They presume they ought not to fear; and, therefore, in
despite of them, wax presumptuously confident. <b>4.</b> They see that
those fears tend to take away from them their pitiful old
self-holiness, and therefore they resist them with all their
might.

<b>HOPE.</b> I know something of this myself; for, before I knew
myself, it was so with me.

<b>CHR.</b> Well, we will leave, at this time, our neighbour Ignorance
by himself, and fall upon another profitable question.

<b>HOPE.</b> With all my heart, but you shall still begin.

<b>CHR.</b> Well then, did you not know, about ten years ago, one
     <b>Temporary</b> in your parts, who was a forward man in
     religion then?

<b>HOPE.</b> Know him! yes, he dwelt in <b>Graceless</b>, a town about two
miles off of <b>Honesty</b>, and he dwelt next door to one <b>Turnback</b>.

<b>CHR.</b> Right, he dwelt under the same roof with him. Well, that
man was much awakened once; I believe that then he had some
sight of his sins, and of the wages that were due thereto.

<b>HOPE.</b> I am of your mind, for, my house not being above three
miles from him, he would ofttimes come to me, and that with many
tears. Truly I pitied the man, and was not altogether without
hope of him; but one may see, it is not every one that cries,
'Lord, Lord, &#151;&#151;.'

<b>CHR.</b> He told me once that he was resolved to go on pilgrimage,
     as we do now; but all of a sudden he grew acquainted
     with one <b>Save-self</b>, and then he became a stranger to me.

<b>HOPE.</b> Now, since we are talking about him, let us a little
inquire into the reason of the sudden backsliding of him and
such others.

<b>CHR.</b> It may be very profitable, but do you begin.

<b>HOPE.</b> Well, then, there are in my judgment four reasons for it:

<b>1.</b> Though the consciences of such men are awakened, yet their
minds are not changed; therefore, when the power of guilt
weareth away, that which provoked them to be religious ceaseth,
wherefore they naturally turn to their own course again, even as 
we see the dog that is sick of what he has eaten, so long as his
sickness prevails he vomits and casts up all; not that he doth
this of a free mind (if we may say a dog has a mind), but
because it troubleth his stomach; but now, when his sickness is
over, and so his stomach eased, his desire being not at all
alienate from his vomit, he turns him about and licks up all,
and so it is true which is written, The dog is turned to his own
vomit again. Thus I say, being hot for heaven, by virtue only of
the sense and fear of the torments of hell, as their sense of
hell and the fears of damnation chills and cools, so their
desires for heaven and salvation cool also. So then it comes to
pass, that when their guilt and fear is gone, their desires for
heaven and happiness die, and they return to their course again.

<b>2.</b> Another reason is, they have slavish fears that do overmaster
them; I speak now of the fears that they have of men, for the
fear of man bringeth a snare. So then, though they seem to be
hot for heaven, so long as the flames of hell are about their
ears, yet when that terror is a little over, they betake
themselves to second thoughts; namely, that it is good to be
wise, and not to run (for they know not what) the hazard of
losing all, or, at least, of bringing themselves into
unavoidable and unnecessary troubles, and so they fall in with
the world again.

<b>3.</b> The shame that attends religion lies also as a block in their
way; they are proud and haughty; and religion in their eye is
low and contemptible, therefore, when they have lost their sense
of hell and wrath to come, they return again to their former
course.

<b>4.</b> Guilt, and to meditate terror, are grievous to them. They
like not to see their misery before they come into it; though
perhaps the sight of it first, if they loved that sight, might
make them fly whither the righteous fly and are safe. But
because they do, as I hinted before, even shun the thoughts of
guilt and terror, therefore, when once they are rid of their
awakenings about the terrors and wrath of God, they harden their
hearts gladly, and choose such ways as will harden them more and
more.

<b>CHR.</b> You are pretty near the business, for the bottom of all is
for want of a change in their mind and will. And therefore they
are but like the felon that standeth before the judge, he quakes
and trembles, and seems to repent most heartily, but the bottom
of all is the fear of the halter; not that he hath any
detestation of the offence, as is evident, because, let but this
man have his liberty, and he will be a thief, and so a rogue
still, whereas, if his mind was changed, he would be otherwise.

<b>HOPE.</b> Now I have shewed you the reasons of their going back, do
you shew me the manner thereof.

<b>CHR.</b> So I will willingly.

<b>1.</b> They draw off their thoughts, all that they may, from the
remembrance of God, death, and judgment to come.

<b>2.</b> Then they cast off by degrees private duties, as closet
prayer, curbing their lusts, watching, sorrow for sin, and the
like.

<b>3.</b> Then they shun the company of lively and warm Christians.

<b>4.</b> After that they grow cold to public duty, as hearing,
reading, godly conference, and the like.

<b>5.</b> Then they begin to pick holes, as we say, in the coats of
some of the godly; and that devilishly, that they may have a
seeming colour to throw religion (for the sake of some infirmity
they have espied in them) behind their backs.

<b>6.</b> Then they begin to adhere to, and associate themselves with,
carnal, loose, and wanton men.

<b>7.</b> Then they give way to carnal and wanton discourses in secret;
and glad are they if they can see such things in any that are
counted honest, that they may the more boldly do it through
their example.

<b>8.</b> After this they begin to play with little sins openly.

<b>9.</b> And then, being hardened, they shew themselves as they are.
Thus, being launched again into the gulf of misery, unless a
miracle of grace prevent it, they everlastingly perish in their
own deceivings.
