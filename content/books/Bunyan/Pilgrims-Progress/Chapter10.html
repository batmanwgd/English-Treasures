<H2>{ <i>Hopeful</i> joins <i>Christian</i> as a pilgrim of The Way }</H2>
<PRE>
<A NAME="Hope">
<font size="+1"><b>Now I saw</b></font> in my dream, that Christian went not forth alone,</A>
for there was one whose name was <font size="+1"><b>Hopeful</b></font> (being made so by the
beholding of Christian and Faithful in their words and
behaviour, in their sufferings at the fair), who joined himself
unto him, and, entering into a brotherly covenant, told him that
he would be his companion. Thus, one died to bear testimony to
The Truth, and another rises out of his ashes, to be a companion
with Christian in his pilgrimage. This <font size="+1"><b>Hopeful</b></font> also told
Christian, that there were many more of the men in the fair,
<A NAME="Bye">that would take their time and follow after.</A>

So I saw that quickly after they were got out of the fair, they
overtook one that was going before them, whose name was
<font size="+1"><b>By-ends</b></font>: so they said to him, "What countryman; Sir? and how
far go you this way?" He told them that he came from the town of
<b>Fair-speech</b>, and he was going to the Celestial City, but told
them not his name.

"From Fair-speech!" said Christian. "Is there any good that
<A NAME="END">lives there?"</A>

<b>By.</b> Yes, said By-ends, I hope.

<b>CHR.</b> Pray, Sir, what may I call you? said Christian.

<b>By.</b> I am a stranger to you, and you to me: if you be going
this way, I shall be glad of your company; if not, I must be
content.

<b>CHR.</b> This town of Fair-speech, said Christian, I have heard of;
and, as I remember, they say it is a wealthy place.

<b>By.</b> Yes, I will assure you that it is; and I have very many
rich kindred there.

<b>CHR.</b> Pray, who are your kindred there? if a man may be so bold.

<b>By.</b> Almost the whole town; and in particular, my Lord
<b>Turn-about</b>, my Lord <b>Time-server</b>, my Lord <b>Fair-speech</b>, from
whose ancestors that town first took its name, also Mr.
<b>Smooth-man</b>, Mr. <b>Facing-both-ways</b>, Mr. <b>Any-thing</b>; and the parson
of our parish, Mr. <b>Two-tongues</b>, was my mother's own brother by
father's side; and to tell you the truth, I am become a
gentleman of good quality, yet my great-grandfather was but a
water-man, looking one way and rowing another, and I got most
of my estate by the same occupation.

<b>CHR.</b> Are you a married man?

<b>By.</b> Yes, and my wife is a very virtuous woman, the daughter
of a virtuous woman; she was my Lady <b>Feigning</b>'s daughter,
therefore she came of a very honourable family, and is arrived
to such a pitch of breeding, that she knows how to carry it to
all, even to prince and peasant. It is true we somewhat differ
in religion from those of the stricter sort, yet but in two
small points: first, we never strive against wind and tide;
secondly, we are always most zealous when religion goes in his
silver slippers; we love much to walk with him in the street,
if the sun shines, and the people applaud him.

Then Christian stepped a little aside to his fellow, Hopeful,
saying, "It runs in my mind that this is one By-ends of
Fair-speech; and if it be he, we have as very a knave in our
company as dwelleth in all these parts." Then said Hopeful,
"Ask him; methinks he should not be ashamed of his name." So
Christian came up with him again, and said, "Sir, you talk as 
if you knew something more than all the world doth; and if I
take not my mark amiss, I deem I have half a guess of you: Is
not your name Mr. By-ends, of Fair-speech?"

<b>By.</b> This is not my name, but indeed it is a nick-name that
is given me by some that cannot abide me: and I must be content
to bear it as a reproach, as other good men have borne theirs
before me.

<b>CHR.</b> But did you never give an occasion to men to call you by
this name?

<b>By.</b> Never, never! The worst that ever I did to give them an
occasion to give me this name was, that I had always the luck to
jump in my judgment with the present way of the times, whatever
it was, and my chance was to get thereby; but if things are thus
cast upon me, let me count them, a blessing; but let not the
malicious load me therefore with reproach.

<b>CHR.</b> I thought, indeed, that you were the man that I heard of;
and to tell you what I think, I fear this name belongs to you
more properly than you are willing we should think it doth.

<b>By.</b> Well, if you will thus imagine, I cannot help it; you
shall find me a fair company-keeper, if you will still admit
me your associate.

<b>CHR.</b> If you will go with us, you must go against wind and tide;
the which, I perceive, is against your opinion; you must also
own religion in his rags, as well as when in his silver
slippers; and stand by him, too, when bound in irons, as well
as when he walketh the streets with applause.

<b>By.</b> You must not impose, nor lord it over my faith; leave me to
my liberty, and let me go with you.

<b>CHR.</b> Not a step further, unless you will do in what I propound
as we.

Then said By-ends, "I shall never desert my old principles,
since they are harmless and profitable. If I may not go with
you, I must do as I did before you overtook me, even go by
myself, until some overtake me that will be glad of my company."
<A NAME="HMS">
<HR align="center" height="2" color="green" width="60%"></A>

<font size="+1"><b>Now</b></font> I saw in my dream that Christian and Hopeful forsook him,
and kept their distance before him; but one of them looking
back, saw three men following Mr. By-ends, and behold, as they
came up with him, he made them a very low conge; and they also
gave him a compliment. The men's names were Mr. <b>Hold-the-world</b>,
Mr. <b>Money-love</b>, and Mr. <b>Save-all</b>; men that Mr. By-ends had
formerly been acquainted with; for in their minority they were
schoolfellows, and were taught by one Mr. <b>Gripe-man</b>, a
schoolmaster in <b>Love-gain</b>, which is a market town in the county
of <b>Coveting</b>, in the north. This schoolmaster taught them the art
of getting, either by violence, cozenage, flattery, lying, or by
putting on the guise of religion; and these four gentlemen had
attained much of the art of their master, so that they could
each of them have kept such a school themselves.
<A NAME="MON">
Well, when they had, as I said, thus saluted each other, Mr.</A>
<font size="+1"><b>Money-love</b></font> said to Mr. By-ends, "Who are they upon the road
before us?" (For Christian and Hopeful were yet within view.)

<b>By.</b> They are a couple of far countrymen, that, after their
mode, are going on pilgrimage.

<b>Mon.</b> Alas! Why did they not stay, that we might have had their
good company? for they, and we, and you, Sir, I hope, are all
going on pilgrimage.

<b>By.</b> We are so, indeed; but the men before us are so rigid, and
love so much their own notions, and do also so lightly esteem
the opinions of others, that let a man be never so godly, yet
if he jumps not with them in all things, they thrust him quite
<A NAME="ALL">out of their company.</A>

<b>All.</b> That is bad, but we read of some that are righteous
overmuch; and such men's rigidness prevails with them to judge
and condemn all but themselves. But, I pray, what, and how many,
were the things wherein you differed?

<b>By.</b> Why, they, after their headstrong manner, conclude that it
is duty to rush on their journey all weathers; and I am for
waiting for wind and tide. They are for hazarding all for God at
a clap; and I am for taking all advantages to secure my life and
estate. They are for holding their notions, though all other men 
are against them; but I am for religion in what, and so far as
the times, and my safety, will bear it. They are for religion
when in rags and contempt; but I am for him when he walks in his
<A NAME="HOL">golden slippers, in the sunshine, and with applause.</A>

<b>Hold.</b> Ay, and hold you there still, good Mr. By-ends; for, for
my part, I can count him but a fool, that, having the liberty to
keep what he has, shall be so unwise as to lose it. Let us be
wise as serpents; it is best to make hay when the sun shines; you
see how the bee lieth still all winter, and bestirs her only when
she can have profit with pleasure. God sends sometimes rain, and
sometimes sunshine; if they be such fools to go through the
first, yet let us be content to take fair weather along with us.
For my part, I like that religion best that will stand with the
security of God's good blessings unto us; for who can imagine,
that is ruled by his reason, since God has bestowed upon us the
good things of this life, but that he would have us keep them for
his sake? Abraham and Solomon grew rich in religion. And Job says,
that a good man shall lay up gold as dust. But he must not be such
as the men before us, if they be as you have described them.

<b>All.</b> I think that we are all agreed in this matter, and
therefore there needs no more words about it.

<b>Mon.</b> No, there needs no more words about this matter,
indeed; for he that believes neither Scripture nor reason (and
you see we have both on our side) neither knows his own liberty,
nor seeks his own safety.

<b>By.</b> My brethren, we are, as you see, going all on
pilgrimage; and, for our better diversion from things that are
bad, give me leave to propound unto you this question:
Suppose a man, a minister, or a tradesman, &c., should have an
advantage lie before him, to get the good blessings of this
life, yet so as that he can by no means come by them except, in
appearance at least, he becomes extraordinarily zealous in some
points of religion that he meddled not with before, may he not
use these means to attain his end, and yet be a right honest
man?

<b>Mon.</b> I see the bottom of your question; and, with these
gentlemen's good leave, I will endeavour to shape you an answer.
And first, to speak to your question as it concerns a minister
himself: Suppose a minister, a worthy man, possessed but of a
very small benefice, and has in his eye a greater, more fat, and
plump by far; he has also now an opportunity of getting of it,
yet so as by being more studious, by preaching more frequently
and zealously, and, because the temper of the people requires
it, by altering of some of his principles; for my part, I see no
reason but a man may do this (provided he has a call), ay, and
more a great deal besides, and yet be an honest man. For why:

<b>1.</b> His desire of a greater benefice is lawful, this cannot
be contradicted, since it is set before him by Providence; so
then, he may get it, if he can, making no question for
conscience' sake.

<b>2.</b> Besides, his desire after that benefice makes him more
studious, a more zealous preacher, &c., and so makes him a
better man; yea, makes him better improve his parts, which is
according to the mind of God.

<b>3.</b> Now, as for his complying with the temper of his people, by
dissenting, to serve them, some of his principles, this argueth:
(1.) That he is of a self-denying, temper; (2.) Of a sweet and
winning deportment; and so (3.) More fit for the ministerial
function.

<b>4.</b> I conclude, then, that a minister that changes a small for a
great, should not, for so doing, be judged as covetous; but
rather, since he has improved in his parts and industry thereby,
be counted as one that pursues his call, and the opportunity put
into his hands to do good.

And now to the second part of the question, which concerns the
tradesman you mentioned. Suppose such a one to have but a poor
employ in the world, but by becoming religious, he may mend his
market, perhaps get a rich wife, or more and far better
customers to his shop; for my part, I see no reason but that
this may be lawfully done. For why:

<b>1.</b> To become religious is a virtue, by what means soever a man
becomes so.

<b>2.</b> Nor is it unlawful to get a rich wife, or more custom to my
shop.

<b>3.</b> Besides, the man that gets these by becoming religious, gets
that which is good, of them that are good, by becoming good
himself; so then here is a good wife, and good customers, and
good gain, and all these by becoming religious, which is good;
therefore, to become religious, to get all these, is a good and
profitable design.

This answer, thus made by this Mr. Money-love to Mr. By-ends's
question, was highly applauded by them all; wherefore they
concluded upon the whole, that it was most wholesome and
advantageous. And because, as they thought, no man was able to
contradict it, and because Christian and Hopeful were yet within
call, they jointly agreed to assault them with the question as
soon as they overtook them; and the rather because they had
opposed Mr. By-ends before. So they called after them, and they
stopped, and stood still till they came up to them; but they
concluded, as they went, that not Mr. By-ends, but old Mr.
Hold-the-world, should propound the question to them, because,
as they supposed, their answer to him would be without the
remainder of that heat that was kindled betwixt Mr. By-ends and
them, at their parting a little before.

So they came up to each other, and after a short salutation, Mr.
Hold-the-world propounded the question to Christian and his
fellow, and bid them to answer it if they could.

<b>CHR.</b> Then said Christian, Even a babe in religion may answer ten
thousand such questions. For if it be unlawful to follow Christ
for loaves, as it is in <b>the sixth of John&#185;</b>, how much more
abominable is it to make of him and religion a stalking-horse to
get and enjoy the world! Nor do we find any other than heathens,
hypocrites, devils, and witches, that are of this opinion:
<b>[&#185;</b>See: <b>John 6:26.]</b>

<b>1.</b> Heathens; for when Hamor and Shechem had a mind to the
daughter and cattle of Jacob, and saw that there was no way for
them to come at them, but by becoming circumcised, they say to
their companions, "If every male of us be circumcised, as they
are circumcised, shall not their cattle, and their substance,
and every beast of theirs, be ours?" Their daughter and their
cattle were that which they sought to obtain, and their religion
the stalking-horse they made use of to come at them. Read the
whole story, Gen. xxxiv. 20-23. <b>[</b> Genesis 34:20-23 <b>]</b>

<b>2.</b> The hypocritical Pharisees were also of this religion; long
prayers were their pretence, but to get widow's houses was their
intent; and greater damnation was from God their judgment.

<b>3.</b> Judas the devil was also of this religion; he was religious
for the bag, that he might be possessed of what was therein; but
he was lost, cast away, and the very son of perdition.

<b>4.</b> Simon the witch was of this religion too; for he would have
had the Holy Ghost, that he might have got money therewith; and
his sentence from Peter's mouth was according.

<b>5.</b> Neither will it out of my mind, but that that man that takes
up religion for the world, will throw away religion for the
world; for so surely as Judas resigned the world in becoming
religious, so surely did he also sell religion and his Master
for the same. To answer the question, therefore, affirmatively,
as I perceive you have done, and to accept of, as authentic,
such answer, is both heathenish, hypocritical, and devilish;
and your reward will be according to your works.

Then they stood staring one upon another, but had not wherewith
to answer Christian. Hopeful also approved of the soundness of
Christian's answer; so there was a great silence among them. Mr.
By-ends and his company also staggered and kept behind, that
Christian and Hopeful might outgo them. Then said Christian to
his fellow, "If these men cannot stand before the sentence of
men, what will they do with the sentence of God? And if they are
mute when dealt with by vessels of clay, what will they do when
they shall be rebuked by the flames of a devouring fire?"
</PRE><A NAME="LUCR">
<HR height="3" color="green"></A>
<H2>{ A Hill called Lucre }</H2>
<PRE>
<font size="+1"><b>Then</b></font> Christian and Hopeful outwent them again, and went till
they came to a delicate plain called <b>Ease</b>, where they went with
much content; but that plain was but narrow, so they were
quickly got over it. Now at the further side of that plain was
a little hill called <b>Lucre</b>, and in that hill a silver mine,
which some of them that had formerly gone that way, because of
the rarity of it, had turned aside to see; but going too near
the brink of the pit, the ground being deceitful under them,
broke, and they were slain; some also had been maimed there, and
could not, to their dying day, be their own men again.
<A NAME="Dema">
Then I saw in my dream, that a little off the road, over against</A>
the silver mine, stood <font size="+1"><b>Demas</b></font> (gentlemanlike) to call to
passengers to come and see; who said to Christian and his
fellow, "Ho! turn aside hither, and I will shew you a thing."

<b>CHR.</b> What thing so deserving as to turn us out of the way to see
<A NAME="DEM">it?</A>

<b>Demas.</b> Here is a silver mine, and some digging in it for
treasure. If you will come, with a little pains you may richly
<A NAME="HOP">provide for yourselves.</A>

<b>HOPE.</b> Then said Hopeful, Let us go see.

<b>CHR.</b> Not I, said Christian, I have heard of this place before
now; and how many have there been slain; and besides that,
treasure is a snare to those that seek it; for it hindereth them
in their pilgrimage. Then Christian called to Demas, saying, 
"Is not the place dangerous? Hath it not hindered many in their
pilgrimage?"

<b>Demas.</b> Not very dangerous, except to those that are careless,
(but withal he blushed as he spake).

<b>CHR.</b> Then said Christian to Hopeful, Let us not stir a step, but
still keep on our way.

<b>HOPE.</b> I will warrant you, when By-ends comes up, if he hath the
same invitation as we, he will turn in thither to see.

<b>CHR.</b> No doubt thereof, for his principles lead him that way, and
a hundred to one but he dies there.

<b>Demas.</b> Then Demas called again, saying, But will you not come
over and see?

<b>CHR.</b> Then Christian roundly answered, saying, Demas, thou art an
enemy to the right ways of the Lord of this way, and hast been
already condemned for thine own turning aside, by one of His
Majesty's judges; and why seekest thou to bring us into the like
condemnation? Besides, if we at all turn aside, our Lord and
King will certainly hear thereof, and will there put us to
shame, where we would stand with boldness before him.

Demas cried again, that he also was one of their fraternity; and
that if they would tarry a little, he also himself would walk
with them.

<b>CHR.</b> Then said Christian, What is thy name? Is it not the same
by the which I have called thee?

<b>Demas.</b> Yes, my name is Demas; I am the son of Abraham.

<b>CHR.</b> I know you; Gehazi was your great-grandfather, and Judas
your father; and you have trod in their steps. It is but a
devilish prank that thou usest; thy father was hanged for a
traitor, and thou deservest no better reward. Assure thyself,
that when we come to the King, we will do him word of this thy
behaviour. Thus they went their way.

By this time <b>By-ends</b> and his companions were come again within
sight, and they, at the first beck, went over to Demas. Now,
whether they fell into the pit by looking over the brink
thereof, or whether they went down to dig, or whether they were
smothered in the bottom by the damps that commonly arise, of
these things I am not certain; but this I observed, that they
never were seen again in the way. Then sang Christian:

      By-ends and silver Demas both agree;
      One calls, the other runs, that he may be
      A sharer in his lucre; so these do
      Take up in this world, and no further go.
