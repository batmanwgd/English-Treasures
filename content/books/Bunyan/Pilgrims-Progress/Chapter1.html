AS I WALKED THROUGH THE WILDERNESS OF THIS world, I lighted on
a certain place where was a <b>Den&#185;</b>, and I laid me down in that
place to sleep: and, as I slept, I dreamed a dream. I dreamed,
and behold, I saw a man clothed with rags, standing in a certain
place, with his face from his own house, a book in his hand, and
a great <b>burden&#178;</b> upon his back. I looked, and saw him open the
book, and read therein; and, as he read, he wept, and trembled;
and, not being able longer to contain, he brake out with a
lamentable cry, saying, "What shall I do?" <b>[&#185;</b>The jail in which
Bunyan had been a prisoner. <b>&#178;Psalm 38:4.]</b>

In this plight, therefore, he went home and refrained himself as
long as he could, that his wife and children should not perceive
his distress; but he could not be silent long, because that his
trouble increased. Wherefore at length he brake his mind to his
wife and children; and thus he began to talk to them: "O my dear
wife," said he, "and you the children of my bowels, I, your dear
friend, am in myself undone by reason of a burden that lieth
hard upon me; moreover, I am for certain informed that this our
city will be burned with fire from heaven; in which fearful
overthrow, both myself, with thee my wife, and you my sweet
babes, shall miserably come to ruin, except (the which yet I
see not) some way of escape can be found, whereby we may be
delivered." At this his relations were sore amazed; not for that
they believed that what he had said to them was true, but
because they thought that some frenzy distemper had got into his
head; therefore, it drawing towards night, and they hoping that
sleep might settle his brains, with all haste they got him to
bed. But the night was as troublesome to him as the day;
wherefore, instead of sleeping, he spent it in sighs and tears.
So, when the morning was come, they would know how he did. He
told them, "Worse and worse"; he also set to talking to them 
again; but they began to be hardened. They also thought to drive
away his distemper by harsh and surly carriages to him;
sometimes they would deride, sometimes they would chide, and
sometimes they would quite neglect him. Wherefore he began to
retire himself to his chamber, to pray for and pity them, and
also to condole his own misery; he would also walk solitarily in
the fields, sometimes reading, and sometimes praying: and thus
for some days he spent his time.

Now, I saw, upon a time, when he was walking in the fields, that
he was, as he was wont, reading in his book, and greatly
distressed in his mind; and, as he read, he burst out, as he had
done before, crying, " <b>What shall I do to be saved?</b>"
<A NAME="Evng"><b>[Acts 16:30,31]</b></A>

I saw also that he looked this way and that way, as if he would
run; yet he stood still, because, as I perceived, he could not
tell which way to go. I looked then, and saw a man named <font size="+1">
<b>Evangelist</b></font> coming to him, who asked, "Wherefore dost thou cry?"

He answered, "Sir, I perceive by the book in my hand, that I am
condemned to die, and after that to come to judgment; and I find
that I am not willing to do the first, nor able to do the
second."

<HR align="left" width="60" size="2" color="blue">

      Christian no sooner leaves the World but meets
      Evangelist, who lovingly him greets
      With tidings of another: and doth shew
      Him how to mount to that from this below.

<HR align="left" width="60" size="2" color="blue">
<A NAME="TOPH">
Then said Evangelist, "Why not willing to die, since this life</A>
is attended with so many evils?" The man answered, "Because I
fear that this burden that is upon my back will sink me lower
than the grave, and I shall fall into <b>Tophet&#185;</b>. And, Sir, if I be
not fit to go to prison, I am not fit, I am sure, to go to
judgment, and from thence to execution; and the thoughts of
these things make me cry." <b>[&#185;</b>The meaning here is &quot;hell&quot; as found
in the AV; correctly translated as <b><i>hades</i></b> in more recent versions.
Until the final judgment at the end of the world, lost souls are
in hades (like a &quot;prison&quot; as Bunyan says above). At the judgment,
they shall be cast into &quot;the lake of fire&quot; (<b><i>hell</i></b>) for eternity.
See: <b>Revelation 20:12-15</b>. See here on the word: &quot;<a href="#TOPHET">Tophet</a>.&quot;<b>]</b>

Then said Evangelist, "If this be thy condition, why standest
thou still?" He answered, "Because I know not whither to go."
Then he gave him a parchment roll, and there was written
within, "Flee from the wrath to come."

The man, therefore, read it, and looking upon Evangelist very
carefully, said, "Whither must I fly?" Then said Evangelist,
pointing with his finger over a very wide field, "Do you see
yonder wicket-gate?" The man said, "No." Then said the other,
"Do you see yonder shining light?" He said, "I think I do." Then
said Evangelist, "Keep that light in your eye, and go up
directly thereto: so shalt thou see the gate; at which, when
thou knockest, it shall be told thee what thou shalt do."

<PRE>
<font size="+1"><b>So I saw</b></font> in my dream that the man began to run. Now, he had
not run far from his own door, but his wife and children,
perceiving it, began to cry after him to return; but the man
put his fingers in his ears, and ran on, crying, "Life! life!
eternal life!" So he looked not behind him, but fled towards
<A NAME="Obst-Pli">the middle of the plain.</A>

The neighbours also came out to see him run; and, as he ran,
some mocked, others threatened, and some cried after him to
return; and, among those that did so, there were two that
resolved to fetch him back by force. The name of the one was
<font size="+1"><b>Obstinate</b></font> and the name of the other <font size="+1"><b>Pliable</b></font>. Now, by this
time, the man was got a good distance from them; but, however,
they were resolved to pursue him, which they did, and in a
little time they overtook him. Then said the man, "Neighbours,
wherefore are ye come?" They said, "To persuade you to go back
with us." But he said, "That can by no means be; you dwell,"
said he, "in <b>the City of Destruction</b>, the place also where I
was born: I see it to be so; and, dying there, sooner or later,
you will sink lower than the grave, into a place that burns with
fire and brimstone: be content, good neighbours, and go along
<A NAME="OBST">with me."</A>

<b>Obst.</b> "What!" said Obstinate, "and leave our friends and<A NAME="CHR">
our comforts behind us?"</A>

<b>CHR.</b> "Yes," said <font size="+1"><b>Christian</b></font>, for that was his name, "because
that ALL which you shall forsake is not worthy to be compared
with a little of that which I am seeking to enjoy; and, if you
will go along with me, and hold it, you shall fare as I myself;
for there, where I go, is enough and to spare. Come away, and
prove my words."

<b>Obst.</b> "What are the things you seek, since you leave all the
world to find them?"

<b>CHR.</b> "I seek an inheritance incorruptible, undefiled, and that
fadeth not away, and it is laid up in heaven, and safe there,
to be bestowed, at the time appointed, on them that diligently
seek it. Read it so, if you will, in my book."

<b>Obst.</b> "Tush!" said Obstinate, "away with your book; will you go
back with us or no?"

<b>CHR.</b> "No, not I, said the other, because I have laid my hand to
the plough."

<b>Obst.</b> "Come, then, neighbour Pliable, let us turn again, and go
home without him; there is a company of these crazy-headed
coxcombs, that, when they take a fancy by the end, are wiser in
<A NAME="PLI">their own eyes than seven men that can render a reason."</A>

<b>Pli.</b> Then said Pliable, "Don't revile; if what the good
Christian says is true, the things he looks after are better
than ours: my heart inclines to go with my neighbour."

<b>Obst.</b> "What! more fools still! Be ruled by me, and go back;
who knows whither such a brain-sick fellow will lead you? Go
back, go back, and be wise."

<b>CHR.</b> "Nay, but do thou come with thy neighbour, Pliable;
there are such things to be had which I spoke of, and many more
glorious besides. If you believe not me, read here in this book;
and for the truth of what is expressed therein, behold, all is
confirmed by the blood of Him that made it."

<b>Pli.</b> "Well, neighbour Obstinate," said Pliable, "I begin to come
to a point; I intend to go along with this good man, and to cast
in my lot with him: but, my good companion, do you know the way
to this desired place?"

<b>CHR.</b> "I am directed by a man, whose name is Evangelist, to speed
me to a little gate that is before us, where we shall receive
instructions about <b>the way</b>."

<b>Pli.</b> "Come, then, good neighbour, let us be going." Then they
went both together.

<b>Obst.</b> "And I will go back to my place, said Obstinate; I will
be no companion of such misled, fantastical fellows."

<H3>{<i>Christian</i> and Pliable on the Plain}</H3>
<PRE>
<font size="+1"><b>Now, I saw</b></font> in my dream, that when Obstinate was gone back,
Christian and Pliable went talking over the plain; and thus they
began their discourse.

<b>CHR.</b> "Come, neighbour Pliable, how do you do? I am glad you are
persuaded to go along with me. Had even Obstinate himself but
felt what I have felt of the powers and terrors of what is yet
unseen, he would not thus lightly have given us the back."

<b>Pli.</b> "Come, neighbour Christian, since there are none but us two
here, tell me now further what the things are, and how to be
enjoyed, whither we are going."

<b>CHR.</b> "I can better conceive of them with my mind, than speak of
them with my tongue: but yet, since you are desirous to know, I
will read of them in my book."

<b>Pli.</b> "And do you think that the words of your book are certainly
true?"

<b>CHR.</b> "Yes, verily; for it was made by <b>Him that cannot lie&#185;</b>."
<b>[&#185;<font color="blue">Titus 1:2</font>; Numbers 23:19.]</b>

<b>Pli.</b> "Well said; what things are they?"

<b>CHR.</b> "There is an endless kingdom to be inhabited, and
everlasting life to be given us, that we may inhabit that
kingdom for ever."

<b>Pli.</b> "Well said; and what else?"

<b>CHR.</b> "There are crowns and glory to be given us, and garments
that will make us shine like the sun in the firmament of heaven."

<b>Pli.</b> "This is very pleasant; and what else?"

<b>CHR.</b> "There shall be no more crying, nor Sorrow: for He that is
owner of the place will wipe all tears from our eyes."

<b>Pli.</b> "And what company shall we have there?"

<b>CHR.</b> "There we shall be with seraphims and cherubims, creatures
that will dazzle your eyes to look on them. There also you shall
meet with thousands and ten thousands that have gone before us
to that place; none of them are hurtful, but loving and holy;
every one walking in the sight of God, and standing in his
presence with acceptance for ever. In a word, there we shall see
the elders with their golden crowns, there we shall see the holy
virgins with their golden harps, there we shall see men that by
the world were cut in pieces, burnt in flames, eaten of beasts,
drowned in the seas, for the love that they bear to the Lord of
the place, all well, and clothed with immortality as with a
garment."

<b>Pli.</b> "The hearing of this is enough to ravish one's heart. But
are these things to be enjoyed? How shall we get to be sharers
thereof?"

<b>CHR.</b> "The Lord, the Governor of the country, hath recorded that
in this book; the substance of which is, If we be truly willing
to have it, he will bestow it upon us freely."

<b>Pli.</b> "Well, my good companion, glad am I to hear of these things:
come on, let us mend our pace."

<b>CHR.</b> "I cannot go so fast as I would, by reason of this burden
that is on my back."

<h2>{The Slough of Despond}</h2>
<PRE>
<font size="+1"><b>Now I saw</b></font> in my dream, that just as they had ended this talk
they drew near to a very miry slough, that was in the midst of
the plain; and they, being heedless, did both fall suddenly into
the bog. The name of the slough was <b>Despond</b>. Here, therefore,
they wallowed for a being grievously bedaubed with the dirt;
and Christian, because of the burden that was on his back, began
to sink in the mire.


<b>Pli.</b> Then said Pliable; "Ah! neighbour Christian, where are you
now?"

<b>CHR.</b> "Truly," said Christian, "I do not know."
<A NAME="Help">
<b>Pli.</b> At this Pliable began to be offended, and angrily said to</A>
his fellow, "Is this the happiness you have told me all this
while of? If we have such ill speed at our first setting out,
what may we expect betwixt this and our journey's end? May I get
out again with my life, you shall possess the brave country
alone for me." And, with that, he gave a desperate struggle or
two, and got out of the mire on that side of the slough which
was next to his own house: so away he went, and Christian saw
him no more. Wherefore Christian was left to tumble in the
Slough of Despond alone: but still he endeavoured to struggle to
that side of the slough that was still further from his own
house, and next to the wicket-gate; the which he did, but could
not get out, because of the burden that was upon his back: but I
beheld in my dream, that a man came to him, whose name was
<font size="+1"><b>Help</b></font>, and asked him what he did there.

<b>CHR.</b> "Sir," said Christian, "I was bid go this way by a man
called Evangelist, who directed me also to yonder gate, that I
might escape the wrath to come; and as I was going thither I
<A NAME="HLP">fell in here."</A>

<b>HLP.</b> "But why did not you look for the steps?"

<b>CHR.</b> "Fear followed me so hard, that I fled the next way, and
fell in."

<b>HLP.</b> Then said he, "Give me thy hand": so he gave him his hand,
and he drew him out, and set him upon sound ground, and bid him
go on his way.

Then I stepped to him that plucked him out, and said, "Sir,
wherefore, since over this place is the way from the City of
Destruction to yonder gate, is it that this plat is not mended,
that poor travellers might go thither with more security?" And he
said unto me, "This miry slough is such a place as cannot be
mended; it is the descent whither the scum and filth that
attends conviction for sin doth continually run, and therefore
it is called the Slough of Despond; for still, as the sinner is
awakened about his lost condition, there ariseth in his soul
many fears, and doubts, and discouraging apprehensions, which
all of them get together, and settle in this place. And this is
the reason of the badness of this ground."

"It is not the pleasure of the King that this place should
remain so bad. His labourers also have, by the direction of His
Majesty's surveyors, been for above these sixteen hundred years
employed about this patch of ground, if perhaps it might have
been mended: yea, and to my knowledge," said he, "here have been
swallowed up at least twenty thousand cart-loads, yea, millions
of wholesome instructions, that have at all seasons been brought
from all places of the King's dominions, and they that can tell,
say they are the best materials to make good ground of the
place; if so be, it might have been mended, but it is the Slough
of Despond still, and so will be when they have done what they
can."

"True, there are, by the direction of the Law-giver, certain
good and substantial steps, placed even through the very midst
of this slough; but at such time as this place doth much spew
out its filth, as it doth against change of weather, these steps
are hardly seen; or, if they be, men, through the dizziness of
their heads, step beside, and then they are bemired to purpose,
notwithstanding the steps be there; but the ground is good when
they are once got in at the gate."

<a href="#TOPH">Back to the story...</a><BR><BR>
&quot;Tophet&quot; is used in Isaiah 30:33 and nine places in Jeremiah 
(see Je 7:31-32). It is also found as &quot;Topheth&quot; in 2 Kings 23:10. 
The references are to a place of burning children as sacrifices to pagan
gods. Also known as &quot;the Valley of Hinnom&quot; (Hebrew:  
&quot;Gehenna&quot;). It was such an infamous place, that Jesus later 
used it to describe the final end of all who would oppose the work of God, 
those who refuse to believe in Him and live their lives for Him. A place of 
eternal firey punishment. (See: Matthew 25:46; 2 Thessalonians 1:8-9.) We 
now call it &quot;hell.&quot; ( There are also two phrases which are 
equivalent references to hell: &quot;the lake of fire&quot; and &quot;the 
second death&quot; &#151; Re 20:14.)
